Monte Carlo simulation to explore Birthday Paradox

Birthday Paradox is the surprisingly high probability that two people will have the same birthday even in a small group of people. In a group of 70 people, there's a 99.9% chance that two people will have a same birthday. In a group as small as 23 people, there's a 50% chance of two people having the same birthday. This program performs several probability experiments to determine the percentages for groups of different sizes.
